## Setup and configuration

The `.env` file is already included, with all the environment variables you will need to make this project work.

The simply have to install the dependences by running

`npm i`

or

`npm install`

## Run the project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can **run** the project. To run this project in development mode, and benefit from **nodemon** 'auto restart on save' feature, you can run

`npm run dev`

otherwise, you can run to simply run the project without **nodemon** with

`npm start`

**Happy coding!**
